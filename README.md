# Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. As a RISC architecture, the RISC-V ISA is a loadâ€“store architecture. Its floating-point instructions use IEEE 754 floating-point. Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include: instruction bit field locations chosen to simplify the use of multiplexers in a CPU,a design that is architecturally neutral, and a fixed location for the sign bit of immediate values to speed up sign extension.

The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. The base instruction set has a fixed length of 32-bit naturally aligned instructions, and the ISA supports variable length extensions where each instruction can be any number of 16-bit parcels in length. Subsets support small embedded systems, personal computers, supercomputers with vector processors, and warehouse-scale 19 inch rack-mounted parallel computers.

**Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords**

Why does a computer needs a RISC or CISC ISA?

Any computer program or software inorder to work on a computer hardware needs to communicate to the layout(chip present on system). Accomplishment of which requires a process to be followed. First the high level language program is converted to assembly level program(which follows a particular architecture RISC-V in this case). After which it's converted to machine level program for computer to understand.For communication between architeture to layout there is need for a interface, called HDL(Hardware Description Language).

Below image show the whole process of program or application execution.

**Applications to Hardware**

Inorder to run any application on the computer system. Below process needs to be followed.

![Architure](https://github.com/DSatle/RISC-V_ISA/assets/140998466/4660910a-3379-476a-9983-20c82239c277)

Operating system, compiler, assembler all three combined are termed as system software.

The assembly language program is dependent on the processor and its architecture. Every architeture has its own assembly language program.
Converting assembly language program to machine level program is done using a specific process, which is elaborated in the flowchart below.

 **Detailed description of detailed of Course content**
 
The course deals with a elaborative study of the instruction types present in the RISC-V architeture. Here I have mentioned types of instruction sets present in the RISC-V architecture

1. Pseduo Instuctions- Examples of pseduo instructions are **mv,li,ret**.

2. Base Integer Instructions - The nomenclature for these instructions is **RV64I** here RV stands for RISC-V, 64 stands for 64 bit integer. Few examples of base integer instructions are **lui,addi,jalr,auipc,ld**.

3. Multiply extension- If there is multiply or divide operation needs to be performed on the numbers these instructions are used. Nomencalture for these instructions is RV64M, and if its multiplication or division on base integer than its nomencleture would be RV64Im

4. Single & double precision floating point extension- If add/sub/divide/multiply is performed on the floating point number this instruction set is used. RV64F & RV64D. Few examples are **flw,fadd.s,fcvt.s.s,fmv.x.d,fsd,fmul.s,fdiv.s,fmv.x.d**. A CPU which performs all above operations is termed as RV64IMFD.

5. Application Binary interface- This is made so that application programmers can access resources of processor like register. Few examples are **a0,SP,s0.**

6. Memory allocation & stack pointer- Transfer of data from memory to registers, stack pointer. Example **ra,24(sp),s0, 16(sp),Sp,32**.
